Virtual Drum Using OpenCV

If you are new to Computer Vision or if you have a strong urge to play the drums but donâ€™t own one, you have come to the right place!

Image processing techniques such as application of a Gaussian filter and thresholding were used in order to track the user's hand and successfully emulate the drum through tracking of its various movements. The contours extracted from the thresholding techniques are tracked by finding their respective bounding rectangles. The result was a system that could emulate a drum and can be played with the hands through striking the different areas of the drum.
